# Hi, I'm Cameron Bowman (Cam-VoidExt) 🛡️

### Seasoned Technical Veteran | Cybersecurity Apprentice
I have spent over 25 years operating at the highest levels of technical services and event production - from serving as West Coast 35mm Technical Director at 20 years old for Hollywood Theatres to beta testing digital infrastructure for Kodak and Dolby in the cinema world. I served as production manager of Trixter's Playground for Luciditiy Festival (2012-2015), Proxy Production Lead for Burning Man YOUtopia Regional and more.

I understand what it means to master a craft, and I am currently applying that same discipline to my transition into cybersecurity.

**The "Seasoned Apprentice" Strategy:** I am currently green in web security, but I bring two decades of high-stakes troubleshooting, technical leadership, and an obsession with finding how systems break. I am moving fast - documenting my journey here before the "apprentice" tag becomes obsolete.
